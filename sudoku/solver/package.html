<BODY>
A generic constrained problem solver and the classes to apply that solver to a SuDoku puzzle.
<P>Really this package should be split in two, one containing the classes representing the generic constrained problem, and 
one for the SuDoku implementation. All the classes are included in one package simply to keep everything in the one "sudoku"
package directory.
